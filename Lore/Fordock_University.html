            Situated just north of Medius Ridge at the southern border of Thurazor lies Fordock University, one of Tir Na Mor's oldest places of research. The 
            university was founded as a result of a large dry cave called the Fordock Depths at the foot of Medius Ridge, which made the area perfect for storing valuables. 
            Locals began touting the area as one of the safest stores for unusual and valuable relics and its popularity began to grow as nobles entrusted their goods
            to the guardians of Fordock. As wealth began to flow into the area, so too did the need for people to defend it. King Mikah the Second decided to pour his 
            resources into arcane research as a means to defend the guarded treasure rather than relying on manpower alone, and an academic scene began to rise up around
            Fordock as a result. Bolstered by the royal coffer and easy access to an unparalleled collection of relics, the Fordock Depths storage facility soon took on a new
            name: Fordock University. Today, the University is still considered the gem of the region, a research facility and museum of worldwide renown. It maintains a near
            spotless track record barring a heist in which the Staff of the Forgotten One was stolen 100 years ago, which now goes down in local legend. The Universirty maintains
            a longstanding rivalry with Cad Begrim University, but many insist that Fordock's knowledge of history puts them at an edge over their rivals. </p>
